= arithmetic-server

This is a tiny demonstration of arithmetic, used in a MicroServices Architecture
course that I teach (https://learningtree.com/1850).
Spring Boot provides the ability to build tiny services like this, thanks to
the Apache Tomcat project's "embeddable Tomcat".

The server uses https on port 8910 with a self-signed certificate.

When the server is running, you can visit https://localhost:8910/expenses to see the data.

This style of project would be quite suitable for use as a MicroService, given
other infrastructure around it.

To start it, you should only need to invoke the 'runserver' script.
